# Green Stock Analysis Using VBA
## Purpose

Steve wants to help his parents invest in stock in a company called Green, for this, he needs a fast and reliable way to do an analysis over the years and be able to determine if DQ is a good option, which his parents have previously chosen.

## Background

For this requirement, we used VBA going through the learning process on how to use loops and calculations, intetrgate interaction elements with the user and  conditional formats to accomplish the target

On a second stage, we improved the code to make it faster by using variable arrays that helped the code not go back and forth between different sheets, just holding values and applying them to reduced loops.

## Results

Another detail that we can see from this analysis is that the higher the volume, the higher the losses, so definitely, DQ is no go.
